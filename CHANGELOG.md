## 0.16.0 - UNRELEASED

### Changed

- Removed a lot of exports that were not used in the public facing API.
- Expose all compression and filter method options via the `encoder_options` module.
- Renamed the following structs in an attempt to make the API easier to navigate:
    - `SevenZArchiveEntry` -> `ArchiveEntry`
    - `SevenZReader` -> `ArchiveReader`
    - `SevenZWriter` -> `ArchiveWriter`
    - `SevenZMethod` -> `EncoderMethod`
    - `SevenZMethodConfiguration` -> `EncoderConfiguration`
    - `MethodOptions` -> `EncoderOptions`
- Internal `Archive` and `SteamMap` fields are removed from the public API.
- Every API that takes a password now uses the `Password` struct instead. Added helper
  functions to create password from strings and raw bytes.
- The needed features for WASM changed. Please use the "default_wasm" feature.

### Removed

- Removed the dependency to `bit-set` and `filetime_creation`.

## 0.15.3 - 2025-06-28

### Fixed

- Properly finish PPMd files.

## 0.15.2 - 2025-06-27

### Fixed

- No functional updates.
- Moved lzma-rust2 and ppmd-rust into their own crates.

## 0.15.1 - 2025-06-22

### Fixed

- Updated outdated documentation.

## 0.15.0 - 2025-06-22

### Updated

- Target optional dependency bzip2 v0.6.

### Changed

- The PPMd crate is using a native Rust version that is validated with Miri. All 7zip supported compression algorithms
  (LZMA, LZMA2, BZIP2 and PPMd) have now Rust native implementations and don't need a C compiler.
- All standard compression algorithms of 7zip are enabled by default.
- Use default feature of lz4_flex

## 0.14.1 - 2025-06-02

### Added

- Added support for ARM64 BCJ filter (by Benkol003).
- Add support for encoding LZ4 with skippable frames.

### Fixed

- Fixed decompressing LZ4 that contain skippable frames.

### Changed

- Use lz4_flex instead of lz4, which is a faster Rust native implementation. The only downside is, that only one
  compression level is supported.

## 0.13.2 - 2025-05-01

### Fixed

- Loose version restrictions on some dependencies.

## 0.13.1 - 2025-04-05

### Fixed

- Fix broken WASM build.

## 0.13.0 - 2025-03-31

### Fixed

- Fix the bug where the optional compression methods did not finish properly
  and created invalid entries when writing 7z archives.

### Changed

- Moved `CountingWriter` from lzma to sevenz crate, since it was an internal implementation detail of the sevenz crate.
- Remove implicit way to call `finish()` by `calling write(&[])` on the lzma and lzma2 writer. This was again an
  implementation detail of the sevenz. `finish()` now also takes `self`, like other compression libraries.

### Added

- `LZMAWriter` and `LZMA2Writer` now expose the inner writer and also return it when calling `finish(self)`.

## 0.12.1 - 2025-03-10

### Fixed

- Fix broken LZ4 feature compilation

## 0.12.0 - 2025-02-28

### Added

- Support for Delta filter compression
- Support for PPDm compression / decompression

## 0.11.0 - 2025-02-26

### Updated

- Updated dependency nt-time to 0.11

### Changed

- Introduced a new feature "util", so that users can deactivate those functionality, if not needed
- Added a lot of documentation tags for docs.rs
- Update of nt-time introduce the need to increase MSRV to 1.85

## 0.10.0 - 2025-02-26

### Changed

- The Brotli codec now supports the skippable frame encoding found in zstdmt (used by 7zip ZS and NanaZip).
  This is the default format, since it seems to be the default for user facing programs. The default data a frame
  contains is 128 KiB.

## 0.9.0 - 2025-02-25

### Added

- Add `SevenZReader::file_compression_methods()`.

### Fixed

- Improve compatibility with third party programs (tested with 7-Zip ZS 1.5.6)
  bzip2, LZ4 and ZSTD now work flawless. BROTLI isn't compatible right now.

## 0.8.0 - 2025-02-25

### Added

- Optional support for compressing / decompressing with BROTLI
- Optional support for compressing with bzip2
- Optional support for compressing / decompressing with DEFLATE
- Optional support for compressing / decompressing with LZ4
- Optional support for compressing with ZStandard

### Changed

- Replaced all unsafe code from sevenz-rust2 and lzma-rust2 with safe alternatives
- sha2 is now an optional dependency that is activated when using the aes256 features
- Update of the documentation
- Removed the need to provide the length of a reader when reading an archive file

## 0.7.0 - 2025-02-24

- Previously deprecated functionality were removed
- Spelling issues were fixed in some API names

### Added

- `SevenZReader::readFile()` added
- `SevenZArchiveEntry::new_file()` and `SevenZArchiveEntry::new_folder()` factory functions added
- Compression method COPY is now supported

### Changed

- Updated dependency bit-set v0.8
- Updated dependency bzip2 v0.5
- Updated dependency nt-time v0.10
- Use crc32fast instead of crc

### Fixed

- Replaces insecure usage of rand with getrandom
- Renamed `get_memery_usage()` into `get_memory_usage()`
- Renamed `compress_encypted()` into `compress_encrypted()`

### Removed

- Removed deprecated `FolderDecoder`. Use `BlockDecoder` instead
